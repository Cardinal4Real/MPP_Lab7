i. If both B and C provide a default implementation of the method(), the class D can choose to override
the method() and provide its own implementation, or it can simply inherit the implementation from one
of the interfaces (B or C) using the super keyword (e.g., B.super.method() or C.super.method()).

ii. If D is also an interface, if one interface is more specific (closer in the inheritance hierarchy),
its default method takes precedence. If there is no clear precedence, the
sub-interface (D) must explicitly resolve the conflict by overriding the method and using the
InterfaceName.super.methodName() syntax to call the desired default method.
